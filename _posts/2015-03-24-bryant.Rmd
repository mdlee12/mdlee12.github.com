```{r, echo=FALSE, 'bryant',  results = 'asis', comment = NA, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8} 
library(rCharts)
library(knitr)
library(base64enc)
bry_age=read.csv("/home/michael/mdlee12.github.com/mdlee12.github.com/bry_age.csv") 
# round data for rChart tooltip display
bryant=nPlot(HR~Age, data=bry_age, type="lineChart",group="Name")
bryant$addControls("y", value = "HR", values = names(bry_age[, 8:24]))
bryant$yAxis( axisLabel = "Total", width = 50 )
bryant$xAxis( axisLabel = "Age", width = 50 ) 
bryant$save("/home/michael/mdlee12.github.com/mdlee12.github.com/_interactives/_figures/bryant.html", standalone = TRUE)
