## Package Description
The NAEP Primer package contains a random mini-sample of real data from the 2005 grade 8 mathematics assessment that have been approved for public use. This includes two data files, as well as a system control file that corresponds to each data file to read in and format for further processing. The NAEP Primer is designed to simplify access to the NAEP database and make its technologies more user-friendly in NAEP data analysis.
