## Package Description
The EdSurvey package is a tool to read and analyze functions for education surveys and assessments data from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/), including the [National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/). Due to the large file sizes and complex formatting of NCES data sets, the package offers user-friendly methods to format and conduct statisitical analyses with a small memory footprint.
