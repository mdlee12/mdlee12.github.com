  Hey there! Welcome to middlee.com, a website of data visualizations, analysis, inquiry and thoughtless musings.
</p>

Aspiring data analyst interested in sports, education, and psychology. Recent experience involves analyses relating to education measures (student demographics, attendance, performance) and sports research (player comparisons, arbitration information, and salary compensation). This interest is founded through a passion for sports, the processes involved in human behavior, and two years teaching special education.
