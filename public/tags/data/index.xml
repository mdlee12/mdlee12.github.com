      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/) The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment that measures 15-year-old students&amp;rsquo; reading, mathematics, and science literacy every three years. First conducted in 2000, the major domain of study rotates between reading, mathematics, and science in each cycle. PISA also includes measures of general or cross-curricular competencies, such as collaborative problem solving. By design, PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of compulsory schooling.</description>

      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/) The International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) is a computer-based international assessment of 8th-grade students&amp;rsquo; capacities &amp;ldquo;to use information communications technologies (ICT) productively for a range of different purposes, in ways that go beyond a basic use of ICT&amp;rdquo; (Fraillon et al., 2018). First conducted in 2013, ICILS assessed students’ computer and information literacy (CIL) with an emphasis on the use of computers as information-seeking, management, and communication tools.</description>

      <description>Background The Center on Great Teachers and Leader&amp;rsquo;s (GTL Center) mission is to support states and districts in their efforts to grow, respect, and retain great teachers and leaders for all students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
The GTL Center has an Excel data tool that is used to reveal insights about the diversity of the educator workforce at the state, district, school, or EPP level. One component of this tool that was missing was a method to map and explore teacher and student ethnicity data by school district.</description>

      <description>Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/talis/) The Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) is a survey about teachers, teaching, and learning environments. Sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), TALIS is composed of two questionnaires—one for teachers and one for their principals—which ask questions about their backgrounds, their work environments, professional development, and their beliefs and attitudes about teaching. TALIS is unique because it is the only comparative international education study that collects data on nationally representative samples of teachers.</description>

      <description>Original Source
I was scrolling twitter and noticed this tweet from David Sparks - Director of Basketball Analytics for the Boston Celtics:
With thanks to @hadleywickham, @hrbrmstr, and @ColorBrewer. #rstats https://t.co/hjX39Xhi4P https://t.co/XD27alzwNI
&amp;mdash; David Sparks (@dsparks) April 22, 2016 
With his obligatory shoutouts to Hadley Wickham and BoB Rudis, I felt compelled to reproduce the plot in RStudio and get some ggplot2 code out there open-sourcing his work.

      <description>The sabr package connects the Lahman SQL Database with functions used in calculating offensive performance in the MLB, namely wOBA. Created by Tom Tango and popularized in The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball, wOBA uses yearly MLB performance to weigh offensive measures relative to league value. This package offers the following capabilities:
 Retrieves the most up-to-date wOBA measures from 1871-2015 Queries yearly and career offensive performance from the Lahman SQL database Calculates a player&amp;rsquo;s seasonal wOBA performance  Installation: Download the latest development version from github:</description>

  Video games have long infiltrated popular culture. This article will attempt to explain that reach. Inspired by FiveThirtyEight&#39;s great article &#34;Designing the Best Board Game on the Planet&#34;, I set out to extend this methodology to video games. The focus of 538&#39;s research related to a robust data set pulled from BoardGameGeek, an exhaustive collection of board games contributed by it&#39;s passionate users.</description>

      <title>Working with Minor League Similarity Scores</title>

      <description>There are some people who see baseball players that way-each one is unique, absolutely not interchangeable with another. I don&#39;t deny the validity of that approach-but if you take that tack, then you can&#39;t turn around and argue that your player should be in the Hall of Fame because his numbers are just as good as this other player&#39;s. &#34;Similarity&#34; is a complex concept, and two players who are not statistically similar may be profoundly similar in some other way.</description>

      <description>Baseball is a game of numbers, some more accessible than others. Rates, averages, linear weights, aging curves, and WAR are only a few of the myriad statistics influencing decision makers in MLB franchises. An endless amount of data is accessible to the average fan at many sites, most notably the Lahman Baseball Database, which is the most robust catalog of MLB player statistics available to the public.  One area of relatively limited accessibility to the average fan is statistics for Minor League players.</description>
