      <description>Background Each Fall and Spring the Nevada Department of Education disseminates a summary report detailing results from a social-emotional learning survey. The report uses a standard template populated with customized text, data values, and data visualizations. Previous productions of these reports were created by a separate contractor. One such example is linked here.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each school&#39;s customized report. One special (read: complex) consideration of this report generation was a requirement for 508 compliance.</description>

      <description>Background The Institute of Museum and Library Services&amp;rsquo; mission is to inspire libraries and museums to advance innovation, lifelong learning, and cultural and civic engagement. Each year it conducts a survey of the nationâ€™s approximately 123,000 libraries and 35,000 museums to provide a snapshot of national and state-level trends.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each state and jurisdiction&#39;s customized report. I acted as an R and LaTeX developer in creation of the template laying out these summary results.</description>
