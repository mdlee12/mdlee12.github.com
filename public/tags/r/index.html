        Mastering the R package ggplot2 The ggplot2 package provides powerful methods to display data as graphics. The beauty of the package lies in it’s simplicity - understanding the core methods (applying variables to aesthetics and transformations) covers ~95% of static visualizations a data visualization developer might be interested in generating. Most of final 5% can be achieved by understanding the infrastructure of the package. One such example is how plot components are “written” to the graphics device.

    <h2 class="content" itemprop="description">
        Background Each Fall and Spring the Nevada Department of Education disseminates a summary report detailing results from a social-emotional learning survey. The report uses a standard template populated with customized text, data values, and data visualizations. Previous productions of these reports were created by a separate contractor. One such example is linked here.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each school&rsquo;s customized report. One special (read: complex) consideration of this report generation was a requirement for 508 compliance.

    <h2 class="content" itemprop="description">
        Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/) The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment that measures 15-year-old students&rsquo; reading, mathematics, and science literacy every three years. First conducted in 2000, the major domain of study rotates between reading, mathematics, and science in each cycle. PISA also includes measures of general or cross-curricular competencies, such as collaborative problem solving. By design, PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of compulsory schooling.

        Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/icils/) The International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) is a computer-based international assessment of 8th-grade students&rsquo; capacities &ldquo;to use information communications technologies (ICT) productively for a range of different purposes, in ways that go beyond a basic use of ICT&rdquo; (Fraillon et al., 2018). First conducted in 2013, ICILS assessed students’ computer and information literacy (CIL) with an emphasis on the use of computers as information-seeking, management, and communication tools.

        Background The Center on Great Teachers and Leader&rsquo;s (GTL Center) mission is to support states and districts in their efforts to grow, respect, and retain great teachers and leaders for all students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
The GTL Center has an Excel data tool that is used to reveal insights about the diversity of the educator workforce at the state, district, school, or EPP level. One component of this tool that was missing was a method to map and explore teacher and student ethnicity data by school district.

        Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/talis/) The Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) is a survey about teachers, teaching, and learning environments. Sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), TALIS is composed of two questionnaires—one for teachers and one for their principals—which ask questions about their backgrounds, their work environments, professional development, and their beliefs and attitudes about teaching. TALIS is unique because it is the only comparative international education study that collects data on nationally representative samples of teachers.
