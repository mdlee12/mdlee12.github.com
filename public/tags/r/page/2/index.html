        Inspiration Virtually following along with rstudio::conf 2020 (and having major conference envy) I heard about Claus Wilke’s new package ggtext. The package supports HTML and markdown styling for text and annotations in ggplot2 graphics. If you’re familiar with HTML or D3.js this seems like a basic feature, but in R graphics this functionality is not natively supported.
Reading this recent 538 article I noticed a neat stacked bar chart:

        Mastering the R package ggplot2 The ggplot2 package provides powerful methods to display data as graphics. The beauty of the package lies in it’s simplicity - understanding the core methods (applying variables to aesthetics and transformations) covers ~95% of static visualizations a data visualization developer might be interested in generating. Most of final 5% can be achieved by understanding the infrastructure of the package. One such example is how plot components are “written” to the graphics device.

        Background Each Fall and Spring the Nevada Department of Education disseminates a summary report detailing results from a social-emotional learning survey. The report uses a standard template populated with customized text, data values, and data visualizations. Previous productions of these reports were created by a separate contractor. One such example is linked here.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each school&rsquo;s customized report. One special (read: complex) consideration of this report generation was a requirement for 508 compliance.

        Background (via https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/) The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment that measures 15-year-old students&rsquo; reading, mathematics, and science literacy every three years. First conducted in 2000, the major domain of study rotates between reading, mathematics, and science in each cycle. PISA also includes measures of general or cross-curricular competencies, such as collaborative problem solving. By design, PISA emphasizes functional skills that students have acquired as they near the end of compulsory schooling.

First conducted in 2013, ICILS assessed students’ computer and information literacy (CIL) with an emphasis on the use of computers as information-seeking, management, and communication tools.
