    <h2 class="content" itemprop="description">
        Mastering Animation in ROver the last couple years Iâ€™ve developed a multitude of animations using R. During this process Iâ€™ve learned quite a bit about R graphics, gpplot2, and useful techniques in animation. In fact I presented on methods for animation in R at satRdays DC - slides available here
One simple technique to improving animations is the addition of pauses. Pauses are an effective method of capturing the viewerâ€™s attention and driving home the main message of an animation.

        Hot Take AlertðŸ”¥ Jonathan Taylor is on pace to be the greatest running back in Wisconsin football history ðŸ”¥
Over the previous three decades Wisconsin has retained several elite rushers (and offensive lines) to amass several conference championships and Rose Bowl appearances. Even when acknowledging Taylorâ€™s case as a serious Heisman candidate in each of his first two years, proclaiming him the presumptive best running back in Wisconsin football history still feels like a bold proclamation.

        Background Each Fall and Spring the Cleveland Metropolitan School District disseminates a summary report detailing results from a survey assessing four social-emotional learning constructs within elementary, middle and high schools. The report uses a standard template populated with customized text, data values, and data visualizations. Previous productions of these reports were created by a separate contractor; one such example is linked here.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each school's customized report.
