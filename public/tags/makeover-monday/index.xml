      <description>Last week I wrote a post about recreating the WSJ measles vaccination chart as an animated cartogram - you can check out the full write-up of the development here: www.mikelee.co/posts/2017-06-28-wsj-measles-vaccination-chart/
It was featured on DataCamp across all their social media platforms - pretty neat!
A comment from one of the readers (which disqus seems to have overwritten as I was re-initializing my site) read as so:
Your measles chart is a beautiful piece of work!</description>
