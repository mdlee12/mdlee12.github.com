      <description>There are some people who see baseball players that way-each one is unique, absolutely not interchangeable with another. I don&#39;t deny the validity of that approach-but if you take that tack, then you can&#39;t turn around and argue that your player should be in the Hall of Fame because his numbers are just as good as this other player&#39;s. &#34;Similarity&#34; is a complex concept, and two players who are not statistically similar may be profoundly similar in some other way.</description>
