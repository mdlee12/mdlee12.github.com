      <description>Background Each Fall and Spring the Nevada Department of Education disseminates a summary report detailing results from a social-emotional learning survey. The report uses a standard template populated with customized text, data values, and data visualizations. Previous productions of these reports were created by a separate contractor. One such example is linked here.
Development The goal for this project was to automate the production of each school&#39;s customized report. One special (read: complex) consideration of this report generation was a requirement for 508 compliance.</description>
