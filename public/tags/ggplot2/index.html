    </h1>
    
    <h2 class="content" itemprop="description">
        Mastering Animation in R Over the last couple years Iâ€™ve developed a multitude of animations using R. During this process Iâ€™ve learned quite a bit about R graphics, gpplot2, and useful techniques in animation. In fact I presented on methods for animation in R at satRdays DC - slides available here
    One simple technique to improving animations is the addition of pauses. Pauses are an effective method of capturing the viewerâ€™s attention and driving home the main message of an animation.

    <h2 class="content" itemprop="description">
        Hot Take Alert ðŸ”¥ Jonathan Taylor is on pace to be the greatest running back in Wisconsin football history ðŸ”¥
 Over the previous three decades Wisconsin has retained several elite rushers (and offensive lines) to amass several conference championships and Rose Bowl appearances. Even when acknowledging Taylorâ€™s case as a serious Heisman candidate in each of his first two years, proclaiming him the presumptive best running back in Wisconsin football history still feels like a bold proclamation.

        This April Iâ€™m visiting Zion National Park, one of North Americaâ€™s most interesting locations to explore geologic formations. One such venue in the park is an iconic hike referred to as The Narrows:
The Narrows in Zion National Park
 Itâ€™s surely even more sensational in person.
Unfortunately, thereâ€™s a catch: the Virgin River, a Colorado river tributary that shaped the distinct rock walls of The Narrows, has seasonal water level changes that can force hikers to trek waist deep in the river or close the route entirely.
