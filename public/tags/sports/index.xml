      <description>Hot Take Alert ðŸ”¥ Jonathan Taylor is on pace to be the greatest running back in Wisconsin football history ðŸ”¥
 Over the previous three decades Wisconsin has retained several elite rushers (and offensive lines) to amass several conference championships and Rose Bowl appearances. Even when acknowledging Taylorâ€™s case as a serious Heisman candidate in each of his first two years, proclaiming him the presumptive best running back in Wisconsin football history still feels like a bold proclamation.</description>

      <title>Working with Minor League Similarity Scores</title>

      <description>There are some people who see baseball players that way-each one is unique, absolutely not interchangeable with another. I don&#39;t deny the validity of that approach-but if you take that tack, then you can&#39;t turn around and argue that your player should be in the Hall of Fame because his numbers are just as good as this other player&#39;s. &#34;Similarity&#34; is a complex concept, and two players who are not statistically similar may be profoundly similar in some other way.</description>

      <description>Baseball is a game of numbers, some more accessible than others. Rates, averages, linear weights, aging curves, and WAR are only a few of the myriad statistics influencing decision makers in MLB franchises. An endless amount of data is accessible to the average fan at many sites, most notably the Lahman Baseball Database, which is the most robust catalog of MLB player statistics available to the public.  One area of relatively limited accessibility to the average fan is statistics for Minor League players.</description>
