      <description>Hot Take AlertðŸ”¥ Jonathan Taylor is on pace to be the greatest running back in Wisconsin football history ðŸ”¥
Over the previous three decades Wisconsin has retained several elite rushers (and offensive lines) to amass several conference championships and Rose Bowl appearances. Even when acknowledging Taylorâ€™s case as a serious Heisman candidate in each of his first two years, proclaiming him the presumptive best running back in Wisconsin football history still feels like a bold proclamation.</description>

      <description>Similarity scores were created by Bill James to compare the careers of Hall of Fame eligible players.In In the most basic sense, similarity scores use aggregated performance statistics to compare a player&#39;s worth for induction into the Hall of Fame. Projection systems follow from this method: Steamer, PECOTA, Marcel, ZiPS, and others use some combination of a player&#39;s recent performance, usually the last 3-4 seasons, to project future performance. Depending on the method, a player&#39;s base statistics are then modified using typical aging curves, linear weights, regression, and numerous other factors.</description>

      <description>To make our database we&#39;re going to use rvest, an R package designed by Hadley Wickham at RStudio [^1]. The package scrapes HTML from webpages and extracts it into readable data. Let&#39;s load the necessary packages and go from there:
#if you haven&amp;#39;t done so already, install rvest from Wickham&amp;#39;s github repository # install.packages(&amp;#34;devtools&amp;#34;) # install_github(&amp;#34;hadley/rvest&amp;#34;) c(&amp;#39;rvest&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;) -&amp;gt; packages #installs packages lapply(packages, library, character.only = T)# prep scraper url &amp;lt;- &amp;#34;http://www.</description>
