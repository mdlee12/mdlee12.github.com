      <description>Mastering the R package ggplot2The ggplot2 package provides powerful methods to display data as graphics. The beauty of the package lies in it‚Äôs simplicity - understanding the core methods (applying variables to aesthetics and transformations) covers ~95% of static visualizations a data visualization developer might be interested in generating. Most of final 5% can be achieved by understanding the infrastructure of the package. One such example is how plot components are ‚Äúwritten‚Äù to the graphics device.</description>

      <description>Mastering Animation in ROver the last couple years I‚Äôve developed a multitude of animations using R. During this process I‚Äôve learned quite a bit about R graphics, gpplot2, and useful techniques in animation. In fact I presented on methods for animation in R at satRdays DC - slides available here
One simple technique to improving animations is the addition of pauses. Pauses are an effective method of capturing the viewer‚Äôs attention and driving home the main message of an animation.</description>

      <description>Hot Take Alertüî• Jonathan Taylor is on pace to be the greatest running back in Wisconsin football history üî•
Over the previous three decades Wisconsin has retained several elite rushers (and offensive lines) to amass several conference championships and Rose Bowl appearances. Even when acknowledging Taylor‚Äôs case as a serious Heisman candidate in each of his first two years, proclaiming him the presumptive best running back in Wisconsin football history still feels like a bold proclamation.</description>

      <description>This April I‚Äôm visiting Zion National Park, one of North America‚Äôs most interesting locations to explore geologic formations. One such venue in the park is an iconic hike referred to as The Narrows:
The Narrows in Zion National Park
It‚Äôs surely even more sensational in person.
Unfortunately, there‚Äôs a catch: the Virgin River, a Colorado river tributary that shaped the distinct rock walls of The Narrows, has seasonal water level changes that can force hikers to trek waist deep in the river or close the route entirely.</description>

Creating a county-level hex grid of Wisconsin makes for a perfect supplment to my earlier post about mapping the 2016 Wisconsin presidential results.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote a post about recreating the WSJ measles vaccination chart as an animated cartogram - you can check out the full write-up of the development here: www.mikelee.co/posts/2017-06-28-wsj-measles-vaccination-chart/
It was featured on DataCamp across all their social media platforms - pretty neat!
A comment from one of the readers (which disqus seems to have overwritten as I was re-initializing my site) read as so:
Your measles chart is a beautiful piece of work!</description>

      <description>Mastering Animation in RUPDATE: In order to reproduce some portions of this code you need the gganimate package using the deprecated API. To access that version, download v0.1.1 here.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Your home state did us no favors&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; As a Wisconsinite transplanted into the highest density of left-leaning voters in the country (District of Columbia) I&#39;ve heard from several friends over the weeks in the aftermath of the US presidential election that voters in my home state should shoulder responsibility for contributing to Donald Trump winning an electoral majority.
The &amp;ldquo;winner-take-all&amp;rdquo; basis in which electoral votes are allocated means the margin of victory in each state is null - extra votes don&#39;t matter - which contributes to an outcome in which a winning candidate can have fewer total votes than another nominee.</description>

      <description>Original Source
I was scrolling twitter and noticed this tweet from David Sparks - Director of Basketball Analytics for the Boston Celtics:
With his obligatory shoutouts to Hadley Wickham and BoB Rudis, I felt compelled to reproduce the plot in RStudio and get some ggplot2 code out there open-sourcing his work.
Package Dependencies and Data
The data was generated using simulations of the NBA Draft lottery, which resulted in some peculiar distributions compared to the raw lottery odds.</description>

 Spend a few months documenting code scripts in RStudio and you&#39;ll have surely seen those introductory lines numerous times.
This is also a R code script. And a markdown document. And an HTML page. All of which are generated within one .</description>

      <description>The sabr package connects the Lahman SQL Database with functions used in calculating offensive performance in the MLB, namely wOBA. Created by Tom Tango and popularized in The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball, wOBA uses yearly MLB performance to weigh offensive measures relative to league value. This package offers the following capabilities:
 Retrieves the most up-to-date wOBA measures from 1871-2015 Queries yearly and career offensive performance from the Lahman SQL database Calculates a player&#39;s seasonal wOBA performance  Installation: Download the latest development version from github:</description>

      <description>Call of Duty :: Frank Underwood // Frogger :: George Costanza // Shinobi :: Wu-Tang Clan // Super Nintendo &amp;amp; Sega Genesis :: ??? That looks pretty sharp, but in the spirit of video games, lets make it a bit more&amp;hellip;8-bit.
I was also curious which themes were most likely to occur simultaneously. Think of the following interactive as such: &amp;ldquo;If I were to randomly select from the pool of Arcade games, what is the likelihood that it also has a _____ theme?</description>

      <description>Similarity scores were created by Bill James to compare the careers of Hall of Fame eligible players.In In the most basic sense, similarity scores use aggregated performance statistics to compare a player&#39;s worth for induction into the Hall of Fame. Projection systems follow from this method: Steamer, PECOTA, Marcel, ZiPS, and others use some combination of a player&#39;s recent performance, usually the last 3-4 seasons, to project future performance. Depending on the method, a player&#39;s base statistics are then modified using typical aging curves, linear weights, regression, and numerous other factors.</description>
